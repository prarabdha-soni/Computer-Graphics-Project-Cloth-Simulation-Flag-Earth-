A flag is a sheet of masses connected together by springs. The masses will move around in space due to forces acting on them - e.g. wind, gravity, or springs between particles. 

Created a globe that interacts with the cloth. This interaction showcases the following: gravity simulation, wind effects and elastic properties. Techniques such as Lighting Effects, and Textures have been used to enhance the objectâ€™s look and the scene.


**Executing**:
